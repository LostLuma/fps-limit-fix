# FPS Limit Fix

A mod fixing the built-in FPS limits in Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 running on the [Ornithe Toolchain](https://ornithemc.net/).

## Details

Changes the `Power Saver` limit from `40` to `60` instead, as this is a more common refresh rate.  
Ensures the `Balanced` limit (defaults to 120 FPS) to actually limits the game's display FPS, instead of being unlimited.
